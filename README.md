# TheHiddenMonster
# Overview

The main goal of this project was to design the framework of a level-based, arcade-style game. You play as a dog’s immune system fighting different kinds of germs. The game currently has 3 different types of germs that spawn in. There is the basic red germ that just moves in a straight line. There is the blue germ that randomly changes its direction every second or two. The purple and green germ will move in a zigzag pattern. The germs will spawn anywhere and will attempt to reach the opposite wall. If they reach it, the player takes damage. The dog’s job is to move around and destroy all the germs before they touch the wall.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used unity’s 2D libraries to create the basic movements and controls. Unity is mainly a 3d game development tool, however, they have an ever-increasing 2D section. All the scripts used in the game are written in C#. I created all the art for the project using a web-based program called Piskel.

# Future Work

* Add more germ types. Creating more germs with new movements and interactions with the player will greatly increase the number of different combinations there can be for levels.
* Create a level-based system. Starting with just the simple red germs, every new level will increase the number of germs to fight off as well as the different types and the speed all the germs are moving.
* Add power-ups. Create powerups that can increase the player's speed or hitbox so that the player can chase down the germs easier.
